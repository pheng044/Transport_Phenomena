    "\n",
    "## \\\"Cookbook Recipe\\\" to Conservation Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section is easier said than done, but it gives a general\n",
    "thought process for deriving and solving transport equations by hand. If\n",
    "you have made it this far in chemical engineering, you have probably\n",
    "figured most of this process out, in which case, the following section\n",
    "is just a list to formalize that process. The only way to truly build\n",
    "intuition is to practice a *lot* of problems. Understanding the\n",
    "transport equations is only one part of the process, but equally as\n",
    "important is understanding how to simplify the problem and impose the\n",
    "correct conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general problem solving process may follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Draw a *good* diagram of the system of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   DO NOT skip this step, it helps in building intuition and\n",
    "        identifying boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Clearly label all of the variables used in the diagram and note\n",
    "        what is known\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Select a coordinate system\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Identify relevant terms in the conservation equation\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What are the generation terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What is the form of the flux?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Is there convection (fluid flow)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Apply assumptions, i.e. steady state, fully developed flow, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Can some terms be assumed constant?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Scaling analysis $-$ What is large? What does not vary a lot in\n",
    "        space?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Are more equations required? i.e. Continuity equation, sum of\n",
    "        mole fractions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Identify boundary conditions $-$ No flux? Fixed value? Convection?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Solve the differential equation(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Does the answer make sense? Does it match intuition? What are the\n",
    "    units of the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Are there \\\"special cases\\\" to try? Ex: setting certain terms to 0,\n",
    "    taking limits at $\\infty$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless other applications of the general conservation\n",
    "equations beyond transport systems. A quite important example left out\n",
    "is the conservation of charge; this leads to Maxwell's equations which\n",
    "are fundamental in the understanding of electricity. Perhaps a more\n",
    "surprising example is found in a quantum mechanics course where one may\n",
    "learn that the probability density, $\\left|\\Psi\\right|^2$, associated\n",
    "with a wavefunction, $\\Psi$, is conserved. This has fundamental\n",
    "consequences on the evolution of molecular systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all of this great generality, there are great costs $-$\n",
    "conservation equations are *hard* to solve. Many times these equations\n",
    "are only numerically solvable and require considerable computational\n",
    "costs. In fact, the conservation of momentum equation or the\n",
    "\\\"Navier-Stokes\\\" equations are so important and difficult to solve that\n",
    "mathematicians have offered a \\$1,000,000 \\\"[Millennium\n",
    "Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness)\\\"\n",
    "to prove certain properties of the equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical computations in [COMSOL](https://www.comsol.com/),\n",
    "[OpenFoam](https://www.openfoam.com/),\n",
    "[MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/), or other multiphysics\n",
    "(transport) simulation software, the user often specifies what terms in\n",
    "the transport equation they want from certain \\\"modules\\\". This is why\n",
    "the focus of this document was on identifying specific terms for\n",
    "generation, flux, diffusion, boundary conditions, etc. as this is what\n",
    "you would practically do in a computation. This identification and\n",
    "modeling of mathematical terms is an important skill to develop if you\n",
    "are interested in computational work or if you want to communicate with\n",
    "somebody who performs these simulations. In short, the takeaway from\n",
    "transport phenomena should not necessarily be on how to solve equations,\n",
    "but rather understanding *modeling* and converting physical problems to\n",
    "mathematics."
