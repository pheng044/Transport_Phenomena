    "## Appendix 3: Development of the Stress Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an advanced development of the stress tensor by\n",
    "considering the symmetries of a fluid. The following derivation assumes\n",
    "knowledge of tensor calculus and Einstein notation for tensors. If these\n",
    "are not known, this section may be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displacement Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deformed volume, let $\\mathbf{X}$ denote the vector of a point in\n",
    "a material from its original position to its new, deformed position. We\n",
    "define the displacement gradient as, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\nabla_j X_i,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla_j$ denotes the covariant derivative and $X_i$ denotes the\n",
    "components of the covariant position vector. This gives a second order\n",
    "tensor which accounts for how far point in a material moves as it is\n",
    "deformed by a differential amount. This tensor is commonly analyzed by\n",
    "decomposing it into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\nabla_j X_i=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla_j X_i+\\nabla_i X_j\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla_j X_i-\\nabla_i X_j\\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we introduce the strain tensor,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\varepsilon_{ij}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla_j X_i+\\nabla_i X_j\\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the vorticity tensor,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\omega_{ij}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla_j X_i-\\nabla_i X_j\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the displacement gradient can be written as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\nabla_j X_i=\\varepsilon_{ij}+\\omega_{ij}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\varepsilon_{ij}$ accounts for pure deformation while $\\omega_{ij}$ accounts for pure\n",
    "rotation (notice its similarity to the 3D curl). To analyze the stress\n",
    "tensor, we only need to account for $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ since we are\n",
    "interested in pure deformation in the absence of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Stress Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "If we postulate the stress tensor, $\\tau$, is linearly proportional to\n",
    "the strain, $\\varepsilon$, then we get the following tensor relation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\tau^{ij}=C^{ijk\\ell}\\varepsilon_{k\\ell},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $C^{ijk\\ell}$ is a\n",
    "4th order tensor called the elasticity tensor. It can be shown that\n",
    "$\\tau^{ij}$ is symmetric in its indices and by considering the elastic\n",
    "potential energy, $U$, and using the definition of stress in Cartesian\n",
    "coordinates,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\tau^{ij}= \\displaystyle \\frac{\\displaystyle \\partial^{}U}{\\displaystyle \\partial \\varepsilon_{ij} ^{}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ C^{ijk\\ell}=\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial\\varepsilon_{ij}\\partial\\varepsilon_{k\\ell}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is symmetric in the index pairs $ij$ and $k\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another constraint is that fluids are isotropic, thus any rotation upon\n",
    "$C^{ijk\\ell}$ leaves it unchanged. A general infinitesimal rotation is\n",
    "described by the operator $R^{i}_s$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ R^{i}_s=g^{ir}\\varepsilon_{rst}\\nabla^t,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varepsilon_{rst}$ is\n",
    "the Levi-Civita tensor. If $C^{ijk\\ell}$ is isotropic, then it should\n",
    "commute with $R^{i}_s$ for any index, giving for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ g^{ir}\\varepsilon_{rst}\\left(C^{sjk\\ell}\\nabla^t-\\nabla^tC^{sjk\\ell}\\right)=0,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to commute with the covariant derivative in every index, $C^{ijk\\ell}$\n",
    "must be proportional to the metrics. One possible combination of this\n",
    "is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ C^{ijk\\ell}=c_1 g^{ij}g^{k\\ell}+c_2 g^{ik}g^{j\\ell}+c_3 g^{i\\ell}g^{jk},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which accounts for all cases due to the symmetry of the metric tensor.\n",
    "There is an additional symmetry constraint, $C^{ijk\\ell}=C^{jik\\ell}$,\n",
    "that results from the symmetry of the stress tensor. This gives,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ 0=c_1 \\left(g^{ij}g^{k\\ell}-g^{ji}g^{k\\ell}\\right)+c_2 \\left(g^{ik}g^{j\\ell}-g^{jk}g^{i\\ell}\\right)+c_3 \\left(g^{i\\ell}g^{jk}-g^{j\\ell}g^{ik}\\right),$$\n",
