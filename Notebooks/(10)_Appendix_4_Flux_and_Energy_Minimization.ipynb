    "## Appendix 4: Flux Through Energy Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes the one argument for energy minimization for\n",
    "flux terms. This has extensively been studied by mathematicians through\n",
    "the so-called \\\"Dirichlet energy\\\". To start, suppose we have a control\n",
    "volume, $V$, where we are given information about what is happening on\n",
    "the boundary and we want to find a function, $u$, that interpolates the\n",
    "data. To get distributed energy, we want an interpolation function that\n",
    "does not rapidly change over the volume or in other words, we want that\n",
    "the function is \\\"smoothed\\\" out. A way of quantifying this is to\n",
    "integrate (sum) the gradient of $u$ over the domain; this gives a global\n",
    "quantifier for the \\\"change\\\" in $u$ over $V$. Therefore, we define the\n",
    "Dirichlet energy, $E$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ E\\left(u\\right):=\\frac{1}{2}\\iiint_V{\\left|\\nabla u\\right| ^2 \\, dV}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice if the function changes rapidly in parts of the control volume,\n",
    "the gradient will be large and thus the integral and energy will be\n",
    "large. To get a smoothed out function, we want that globally (over the\n",
    "entire volume), the energy should be *minimized*, or the change in $u$\n",
    "at every point should be as small as possible. Physically, $\\nabla u$ is\n",
    "the generalized force acting on the system while $u$ is the potential\n",
    "energy. We want to find a potential energy function, $u$, that minimizes\n",
    "the Dirichlet energy. This entails introducing a \\\"functional\n",
    "derivative\\\" so that we can speak of minimization. We define the\n",
    "functional derivative as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\displaystyle \\frac{\\displaystyle \\delta^{}E}{\\displaystyle \\delta v ^{}}:=\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to0}\\frac{E\\left(u+\\varepsilon v\\right)-E\\left(u\\right)}{\\varepsilon}.$$\n",

    "These are interpreted as a measure of how $E$ changes as the input, $u$,\n",
    "changes by a little amount $\\varepsilon v$. $u$ and $v$ are any \\\"nice\\\"\n",
    "functions, but we often choose the variation function, $v$, such that,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ ||v||_{ }^2:=\\iiint_V{v^2 \\, dV}=1,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "which means the\n",
    "\\\"norm\\\" or size of $v$ is 1. Now to minimize the Dirichlet energy, we\n",
    "take the functional derivative and set it equal to 0 and use\n",
